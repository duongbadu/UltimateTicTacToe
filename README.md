Game that evolves TicTacToe (Cocos2Dx)

Original Idea by Ben Meredith

This is my implementation of a game that should remove a flaw in it's simpler version TicTacToe:
What we are testing is to find out if there can be a version that keeps some basic mechanics of TicTacToe but remove the optimal strategy, and if we find one what can it be represented as, to test this i'm also writing an ANN that can play these different versions and learn, if one exists, the optimal strategy.
